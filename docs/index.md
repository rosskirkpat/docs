# 1. Background
## 1.1. Scheduling

### 1.1.1 RKE1 Windows Scheduling

RKE1 Windows Workload scheduling is based on taints and tolerations.

Every Linux node in an RKE1 Windows cluster, regardless of the role assigned to it, will have have a default taint that prevents workloads to be scheduled on it unless the workload has a toleration configured. This is a major design feature for RKE1 Windows clusters which were designed to only run Windows workloads.

Default RKE1 Linux Node `NoSchedule` Taint

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Node
spec:
  ...
  taints:
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: cattle.io/os
    value: linux
```

RKE1 Linux `NoSchedule` Toleration for Workloads

The following toleration would allow an end-user workload to schedule on any Linux node of an RKE1 Windows cluster. These tolerations are used for various core Rancher services and workloads.  

```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - effect: NoSchedule
        key: cattle.io/os
        operator: Equal
        value: linux
```

Aligning with best practices, any end-user workloads being ran on Linux nodes would be scheduled on those with the worker role only. 

```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - effect: NoSchedule
        key: cattle.io/os
        operator: Equal
        value: linux
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - preference:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/worker
                operator: In
                values:
                - "true"
            weight: 100
      ...
```

### 1.1.2 RKE2 Windows Scheduling

Based on feedback and requests for hybrid workload support, RKE2 Windows was designed to support both Linux and Windows workloads by default. RKE2 scheduling relies on node selectors by default. This is a marked change from RKE1 as taints and tolerations were not incorporated into RKE2. Node selectors were a critical part of RKE1 Windows clusters, which makes for an easy migration of your workloads. 

### 1.2 Example Migrations

#### 1.2.1 RKE1 to RKE2 Windows Workload

Pre-Migration RKE1 Windows Deployment

```yaml

          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: kubernetes.io/os
                operator: NotIn
                values:
                - linux
```


Migrated RKE2 Windows Deployment Using `NodeAffinity` 

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1

      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
              - matchExpressions:
                  - key: kubernetes.io/os
                    operator: In
                    values:

# 2. Guiding Migrations of Workloads to RKE2 Windows
  
Referencing the tables in [Rancher Manager 2.5 vs. Rancher Manager 2.6 Support Matrix for Windows Clusters](#rancher-25-vs-rancher-26-support-matrix-for-windows-clusters) and [Rancher Manager 2.5 vs Rancher Manager 2.6 Supported Kubernetes Versions for Provisioning RKE1 and RKE2 Windows Clusters](#rancher-25-vs-rancher-26-supported-kubernetes-versions-for-provisioning-rke1-and-rke2-windows-clusters), you will find the overlap in Kubernetes versions between RKE1 and RKE2 occurs in 1.22. This will be the base version required to migrate RKE1 Windows workloads when following the Rancher Manager recommended approach.

## 2.1. Steps for migrating RKE1 Windows Workloads 

### 2.1.1. In-Place Upgrade of Rancher Manager 2.5

- [ ] Upgrade the Rancher Manager version to v2.6.5+ 
- [ ] Upgrade the RKE1 Windows downstream cluster(s) to RKE1 v1.22 using the latest available patch version
- [ ] Provision a new RKE2 Windows downstream cluster using RKE2 v1.22 using the matching patch version that the RKE1 Windows cluster is at
- [ ] Begin the migration of the Windows workloads from RKE1 to RKE2 clusters
- [ ] Perform validation tests to ensure that there has been no functionality loss or change when migrating your application from RKE1 to RKE2
- [ ] After successful validation tests have occurred, you can opt to upgrade your RKE2 1.22.x cluster to a new minor version such as 1.23 or 1.24.


### 2.1.2. [Requires v2.6.5+] Migrating Windows Workloads to a new Rancher Manager environment

#### 2.1.2.1. Use matching Kubernetes patch versions for RKE and RKE2

- [ ] Provision a new RKE2 Windows downstream cluster using RKE2 v1.22 using the matching patch version that the RKE1 Windows cluster is at
- [ ] Begin the migration of the Windows workloads from RKE1 to RKE2 clusters
- [ ] Perform validation tests to ensure that there has been no functionality loss or change when migrating your application from RKE1 to RKE2
- [ ] After successful validation tests have occurred, you can opt to upgrade your RKE2 1.22.x cluster to a new minor version such as 1.23 or 1.24.


#### 2.1.2.2. Use a Newer Kubernetes Patch Version for RKE2

- [ ] Provision a new RKE2 Windows downstream cluster using RKE2 v1.23 or v1.24
- [ ] Begin the migration of the Windows workloads from RKE1 to RKE2 clusters
- [ ] Perform validation tests to ensure that there has been no functionality loss or change when migrating your application from RKE1 to RKE2
